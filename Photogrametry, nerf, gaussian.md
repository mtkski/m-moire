# Photogrammetry
One big advantage is the metrics. You can make measurements on a photogrammetry representation. You can't do that on the other two.  
Gives a _mesh_ with texture. 
# NeRF
Volumetric representation. It gives a way to _simulate_ novel views. 

# Gaussian splat
The scene is represented in real time by these gaussians splats. More crisp than nerf. Can work in unity.
