In our experiments, we use a batch size of 4096 rays, each sampled at Nc = 64 coordinates in the coarse volume and Nf = 128 additional coordinates in the fine volume. We use the Adam optimizer [18] with a learning rate that begins at 5 × 10−4 and decays exponentially to 5 × 10−5 over the course of optimization (other Adam hyperparameters are left at default values of β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and ε = 10−7). The optimization for a single scene typically take around 100– 300k iterations to converge on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU (about 1–2 days).
